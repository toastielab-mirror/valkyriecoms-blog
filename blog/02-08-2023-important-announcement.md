Hi guys I just wanted to let you all know that the current Valkyriecoms instance will be going down this Friday around 10am or 12pm NZST (you might need to translate this to your own timezone as I currently can not) I will post an announcement in the Valkyriecoms Discord when this happens.

That is all for now,

Toastie and the Valkyriecoms team
